OBJECTIVE:
Building production ready MUI prototypes

REASON:
This helps people collaborate and demo design decisions sooner in the UX design process

DESCRIPTION:
Use the following instructions to build a MUI application with MDX for documentation, whenever you build a prototype for me, regardless if I specify that framework or not.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a responsive React application using the latest stable version of Material-UI (MUI v7.3) that precisely matches the provided [screenshot], [url], or [example]

The information below is what I want to implement when I use Bolt. For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

Include the following specifications:

1. Replicate the exact layout and visual design for responsive layout using Container Queries, spacing, and visual hierarchy shown in the [image] or [url]. Make sure to use the updated MUI Grid syntax (https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid) when using the Grid component
2. Implement exact padding, margins, and spacing as shown.
3. Match all colors, typography, and component styling from the screenshot
4. Include any interactive elements (buttons, forms, etc.) with appropriate hover/focus states
5. Ensure accessibility standards are met with proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
6. Use MUI components and styling system (sx prop or styled components)
7. Include proper component organization and file structure
8. DO NOT use Tailwind or any other CSS framework other than the MUI theme for styling. Use MUI's theme provider for consistent styling.
9. DO NOT use webfonts for UI icons, BUT use inline SVG instead.
10. Always create a theme palette (light/dark) with "cssVariables" enabled: https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/css-theme-variables/usage/#light-and-dark-modes
11. Always add a color mode toggle demo and function that uses the MUI prescribed method: https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/dark-mode/#toggling-color-mode & https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/css-theme-variables/configuration/#toggling-dark-mode-manually
12. Follow the MUI documentation to avoid color mode flicker on toggle or page reload: https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/dark-mode/#dark-mode-flicker
13. Always apply the user's system preference color mode (MUI default) and use localStorage to save their manual setting: https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/dark-mode/#system-preference
14. ALWAYS use the new MUI <Grid> syntax for layouts: https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid/
