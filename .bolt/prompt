OBJECTIVE:
Building production ready MUI applications

REASON:
This helps people collaborate and demo design decisions sooner in the UX design process, while providing production ready code for our development teams.

DESCRIPTION:
Use the following instructions to build a React/MUI application, whenever you build a prototype for me, regardless if I specify that framework or not.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a responsive React application using the latest stable version of Material-UI (MUI v7.3) and precisely match any provided [screenshot], [url], or [example].

The information below is what I want to implemented for all designs I ask you to make. Make them beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

Before you start a task, or make a change—follow these instructions and rules: 

- ALWAYS read our Web Interface Guidelines before creating UI: https://assets.codepen.io/97621/web-interface-guidelines.instructions.md

- DO NOT change the visual design, theme styling, or composition of the UI once a `checkpoint`, and/or a component or pattern has been established. 

- DO NOT revert any "styling" (CSS/Layout) or "scripting" (TS/JSX) change intentionally by me.

- DO NOT make changes outside the scope of the requested feature, i.e., don't modify the main navigation when asked to build a data table.

Include the following specifications:

1. Accessibility and Performance are always to be considered as first-class features and prioritized over anything else when making architecture decisions. Ensure accessibility standards are met with proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML using native interactive elements (buttons, inputs, etc.) with appropriate hover/focus/keyboard/screenreader states.

2. Always use Adaptive Layout and Mobile UX best practices when applying visual design techniques. Use Container Queries, clamp() with dynamic and container based viewport units (e.g., cqw, dvh), etc., for spacing, visual hierarchy, and interaction design.

3. Use Progressive Enhancement to apply Modern but Accessible CSS: https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2025/

4. Replicate the exact layout and visual design for responsive layout using Container Queries, spacing, and visual hierarchy shown in the [image] or [url]. ALWAYS use the new MUI <Grid> syntax for layouts: https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid/
5. Create and Implement elegant and maintainable color palettes, typography scales, and robust spacing system.
7. Include any interactive elements (buttons, forms, etc.) with appropriate hover/focus states
5. Ensure accessibility standards are met with proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
6. Use MUI components and styling system (sx prop or styled components)
7. Include proper component organization and file structure
8. DO NOT use Tailwind or any other CSS framework other than the MUI theme for styling. Use MUI's theme provider for consistent styling.
9. DO NOT use webfonts for UI icons, BUT use inline SVG instead.
10. Always create a theme palette (light/dark) with "cssVariables" enabled: https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/css-theme-variables/usage/#light-and-dark-modes
11. Always add a color mode toggle demo and function that uses the MUI prescribed method: https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/dark-mode/#toggling-color-mode & https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/css-theme-variables/configuration/#toggling-dark-mode-manually
12. Follow the MUI documentation to avoid color mode flicker on toggle or page reload: https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/dark-mode/#dark-mode-flicker
13. Always apply the user's system preference color mode (MUI default) and use localStorage to save their manual setting: https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/dark-mode/#system-preference
